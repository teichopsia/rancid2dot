rancid to graphviz circuit mesh generator
==

this was a live script used to visualize as3549 (global crossing)
when I worked there. the original was perl5. updated to python3.

not the best way to do things but when you have nothing for topological
data something > nothing.

mostly historical amusement unless you have a rancid archive
